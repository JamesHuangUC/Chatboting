# Chatboting

This is a Facebook messenger chatbot. Currently, the chatbot is able to have a simple conversation with the user, and forcast weather. There will be more features adding to it.
Open your messenger app, and scan the QR Code below for trying this bot by asking "Hello", "How are you?", "How's the weather in San Francisco?", etc. You can also access it by going to this link: [m.me/ChatBoting](https://m.me/ChatBoting).
